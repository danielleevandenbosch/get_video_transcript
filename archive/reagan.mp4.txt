[00:00:00 - 00:00:09] And now, now the Soviets themselves may in a limited way be coming to understand the importance of freedom.

[00:00:09 - 00:00:14] We hear much from Moscow about a new policy of reform and openness.

[00:00:14 - 00:00:17] Some political prisoners have been released.

[00:00:17 - 00:00:21] Certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed.

[00:00:21 - 00:00:27] Some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control.

[00:00:27 - 00:00:32] Are these the beginnings of profound changes in the Soviet state?

[00:00:32 - 00:00:38] Or are they token gestures intended to raise false hopes in the West

[00:00:38 - 00:00:43] or to strengthen the Soviet system without changing it?

[00:00:43 - 00:00:50] We welcome change and openness, for we believe that freedom and security go together,

[00:00:50 - 00:01:00] that the advance of human liberty, the advance of human liberty, can only strengthen the cause of world peace.

[00:01:00 - 00:01:05] There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable,

[00:01:05 - 00:01:11] that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace.

[00:01:11 - 00:01:17] General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace,

[00:01:17 - 00:01:22] if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,

[00:01:22 - 00:01:27] if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate.

[00:01:27 - 00:01:31] Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate.

[00:01:47 - 00:01:57] Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.

[00:01:57 - 00:02:04] I understand the fear of war and the pain of war.

[00:02:04 - 00:02:11] I understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent.

[00:02:11 - 00:02:24] And I pledge to you my country's efforts to help overcome these burdens.

[00:02:24 - 00:02:30] To be sure we in the West must pre-resist Soviet expansion.

[00:02:30 - 00:02:35] So we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength.

[00:02:35 - 00:02:42] Yet we seek peace so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides.

[00:02:42 - 00:02:48] Beginning ten years ago, the Soviets challenged the Western Alliance with a grave new threat.

[00:02:48 - 00:02:56] Hundreds of new and more deadly SS-20 nuclear missiles capable of striking every capital in Europe.

[00:02:56 - 00:03:01] The Western Alliance responded by committing itself to a counter deployment.

[00:03:01 - 00:03:05] Unless the Soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution,

[00:03:05 - 00:03:10] namely the elimination of such weapons on both sides.

[00:03:10 - 00:03:16] For many months, the Soviets refused to bargain in earnestness.

[00:03:16 - 00:03:21] As the Alliance in turn prepared to go forward with its counter deployment,

[00:03:21 - 00:03:29] there were difficult days, days of protests, like those during my 1982 visit to this city.

[00:03:29 - 00:03:33] And the Soviets later walked away from the table.

[00:03:33 - 00:03:38] But through it all, the Alliance held firm.

[00:03:38 - 00:03:41] And I invite those who protested then.

[00:03:41 - 00:03:46] I invite those who protested today to mark this fact.

[00:03:46 - 00:03:52] Because we remain strong, the Soviets came back to the table.
